# Topological Sort

Source code can be found in the src directory. There is a non templated version of topological sort working with ints and a templated version. 

To use the templated topological sort it is necessary to copy the files "templated_topological_sort.cpp" and  "templated_topological_sort.h" to your project and include both in the source file using the algorithm.
