# Fast Fourier Transform

Templated Fast Fourier Transform using the standard recursive method. Files include methods to get the
power spectrum fron the Fourier transform and also to shift the spectrum so that the frequency of 0 is 
centered. 

Requires an input of a complex vector.

## TODO

Code the in place FFT and also FFT for real only input.
